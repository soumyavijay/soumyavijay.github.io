Hello world,
I am Soumya, pronounced Sou (like wow), m (like mmm) ya (like yeah). 

I am good at solving problems by building simple, scalable solutions. The skill has come in handy in my journey as a developer, product manager and author.

When not solving problems, I love to read about X, write a short story, do wood work and ride my Ninja 300. (Not all at the same time, else this would be a eulogy).
